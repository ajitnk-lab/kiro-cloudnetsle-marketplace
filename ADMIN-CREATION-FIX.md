# Admin User Creation Fix - Summary

## Problem
The admin user creation script was failing with the error:
```
InvalidParameterException: Attributes did not conform to the schema: 
Type for attribute {custom:userId} could not be determined
```

## Root Cause
The `create-admin-user.js` script was trying to set a `custom:userId` attribute in Cognito, but the User Pool schema only had `custom:role` defined. The `marketplace-infrastructure-stack.ts` was missing the `userId` custom attribute definition.

## Solution
Instead of adding the `userId` custom attribute to Cognito (which would require redeploying the User Pool), we simplified the approach by:

1. **Removed the `custom:userId` attribute** from the Cognito user creation in `create-admin-user.js`
2. **Kept userId only in DynamoDB** where it's actually needed for application logic
3. **Updated the script** to use the correct stack name: `MP-1759828592217`

## Changes Made

### File: `packages/infrastructure/scripts/create-admin-user.js`
- Removed `custom:userId` from the UserAttributes array in AdminCreateUserCommand
- The userId is still generated and stored in DynamoDB, just not in Cognito

### File: `create-admin.ps1`
- Updated stack name from `MP-1759827819585` to `MP-1759828592217`

## Verification

### Cognito User Pool
```bash
aws cognito-idp admin-get-user --user-pool-id us-east-1_sAAMN4Mi6 --username "ajitnk2006+admin@gmail.com"
```

**Result:** ✅ User created successfully with:
- Email: ajitnk2006+admin@gmail.com
- Email verified: true
- Custom role: admin
- Status: CONFIRMED

### DynamoDB User Table
```bash
aws dynamodb scan --table-name marketplace-users-1759828592371 --limit 5
```

**Result:** ✅ User record created with:
- userId: be82c5c7-3284-4408-bf3b-39c621f6f6e5
- email: ajitnk2006+admin@gmail.com
- role: admin
- status: active
- permissions: Full admin permissions array
- profile: Name and email

## Admin Login Credentials

**Email:** ajitnk2006+admin@gmail.com  
**Password:** Admin123!@#  
**Role:** admin

**Admin Dashboard URL:** https://dddzq9ul1ygr3.cloudfront.net/admin/dashboard

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Admin user created successfully
2. Test login with the admin credentials
3. Change the default password after first login
4. Test admin workflows:
   - Approve partner applications
   - Moderate solutions
   - Manage users

## Architecture Note

The minimal approach keeps:
- **Cognito:** Authentication + role attribute
- **DynamoDB:** Full user profile + userId + permissions

This separation is cleaner and avoids unnecessary duplication of data in Cognito custom attributes.
