```

```bash
# Check AWS configuration
aws sts get-caller-identity

# If not configured, run:
aws configure
```

```bash
# Check current region
aws configure get region

# SES is available in most regions, but verify:
aws ses describe-configuration-sets --region us-east-1
```

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ses:VerifyEmailIdentity",
        "ses:GetIdentityVerificationAttributes",
        "ses:SendEmail",
        "ses:SendRawEmail"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
