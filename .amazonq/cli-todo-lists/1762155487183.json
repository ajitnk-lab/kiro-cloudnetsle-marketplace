API Gateway is returning empty applications array despite Lambda logs showing 7-8 pending applications. The admin endpoint is working but returning empty results. Need to check Lambda function code for admin applications endpoint.","ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Admin function is using wrong DynamoDB table name. Admin function uses 'MP-1759859484941-DataStackPartnerApplicationTable548221AF-18TWY57Q2Z5ZR' (empty) but applications are in 'MP-1759859484941-DataStackPartnerApplicationTable548221AF-1XYHN9D5GAA2F' (has 11 items with 7 pending). Need to update admin function environment variable.","SUCCESS! Fixed the issue completely. Admin API endpoint now returns 7 pending partner applications correctly. The issue was: 1) Admin Lambda function environment variable pointing to wrong DynamoDB table name, 2) IAM role missing permissions for the correct table. Both issues resolved and API working perfectly."],"modified_files":[],"id":"1762155487183"}
