The FAISS UI correctly extracts tier parameter from URL (line 247: tier: urlParams.get('tier')) and stores it (line 318: localStorage.setItem('marketplace_tier', marketplaceTier || '')). The issue is that the marketplace catalog is NOT passing the tier=pro parameter when generating the URL to FAISS. The catalog Lambda only returns static solution metadata with externalUrl: https://awssolutionfinder.solutions.cloudnestle.com/search - no authentication parameters are added."],"modified_files":[],"id":"1764595533136"}
