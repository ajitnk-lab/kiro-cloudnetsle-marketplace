# Complete Infrastructure Verification

## Macro Level - What Should Be Deployed (Per Tasks)

### Phase 1 Tasks (Marked Complete):
1. ✅ Project structure - DONE
2. ✅ Core infrastructure - **NEEDS VERIFICATION**
3. ✅ Authentication system - **NEEDS VERIFICATION**
4. ✅ User management backend - **NEEDS VERIFICATION**
5. ✅ Solution catalog backend - **NEEDS VERIFICATION**
6. ✅ Frontend marketplace - DONE (code exists)
7. ✅ Payment processing - **NEEDS VERIFICATION**
8. ✅ Sample data seeding - DONE (scripts exist)
9. ✅ User dashboard - DONE (code exists)
10. ✅ Error handling - DONE (code exists)

### Phase 2 Tasks (Partially Complete):
11. ✅ Partner registration - **NEEDS VERIFICATION**
12. ⚠️ Partner solution management - 80% complete

## Micro Level - Infrastructure Components Analysis

### 1. DATA STACK (data-stack.ts)
**Status: INCOMPLETE - Has Issues**

#### Issues Found:
- ❌ Still has `cdk.Aws.ACCOUNT_ID` in table names (will cause conflicts)
- ❌ Some tables have `RETAIN` removal policy (will block deletion)
- ❌ Some tables have `pointInTimeRecovery: true` (costs money, blocks deletion)
- ❌ Unused imports (rds, ec2)

#### Tables to Fix:
1. ✅ userTable - FIXED (DESTROY, no ACCOUNT_ID)
2. ✅ solutionTable - FIXED (DESTROY, no ACCOUNT_ID)
3. ⚠️ sessionTable - HAS ACCOUNT_ID
4. ✅ partnerApplicationTable - FIXED
5. ⚠️ transactionTable - HAS ACCOUNT_ID + RETAIN + PITR
6. ⚠️ userSolutionsTable - HAS ACCOUNT_ID + RETAIN + PITR
7. ⚠️ commissionSettingsTable - HAS ACCOUNT_ID + RETAIN + PITR
8. ⚠️ partnerEarningsTable - HAS ACCOUNT_ID + RETAIN + PITR
9. ⚠️ assetsBucket - HAS ACCOUNT_ID

### 2. AUTH STACK (auth-stack.ts)
**Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION**

#### Potential Issues:
- Google OAuth with hardcoded credentials
- GitHub OAuth commented out
- User Pool has RETAIN policy
- Post-confirmation Lambda trigger

### 3. API STACK (api-stack.ts)
**Status: NEEDS VERIFICATION**

#### Potential Issues:
- Hardcoded Instamojo test credentials
- Multiple Lambda functions need verification
- API Gateway routes need verification
- IAM permissions need verification

### 4. MAIN STACK (marketplace-infrastructure-stack.ts)
**Status: RECENTLY UPDATED**

#### Current State:
- ✅ Uses DataStack, AuthStack, ApiStack (proper composition)
- ✅ Passes uniqueSuffix to prevent conflicts
- ✅ Has proper outputs

## Critical Fixes Needed Before Deployment

### Priority 1 - BLOCKING ISSUES (Must Fix):
1. Remove `cdk.Aws.ACCOUNT_ID` from ALL table names
2. Change ALL `RETAIN` to `DESTROY` for dev environment
3. Disable `pointInTimeRecovery` on ALL tables
4. Remove unused imports (rds, ec2)

### Priority 2 - DEPLOYMENT FAILURES (Must Fix):
1. Fix Google OAuth credentials (use environment variables or remove)
2. Fix Instamojo credentials (use environment variables)
3. Verify all Lambda function code exists
4. Verify all Lambda handlers match file exports

### Priority 3 - FUNCTIONALITY (Should Fix):
1. Verify Cognito custom attributes match what Lambda expects
2. Verify DynamoDB GSI names match what Lambda queries use
3. Verify S3 bucket permissions for Lambda
4. Verify API Gateway CORS settings

## Verification Checklist

### Before Deploy:
- [ ] All table names use only `uniqueSuffix` (no ACCOUNT_ID)
- [ ] All tables have `removalPolicy: DESTROY`
- [ ] All tables have `pointInTimeRecovery: false`
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in code
- [ ] All Lambda function files exist
- [ ] All Lambda handlers are correct
- [ ] Cognito custom attributes defined
- [ ] No VPC/RDS resources (removed for cost)

### After Deploy:
- [ ] All stacks deploy successfully
- [ ] All Lambda functions created
- [ ] API Gateway endpoints accessible
- [ ] Cognito User Pool created
- [ ] DynamoDB tables created with GSIs
- [ ] S3 bucket created
- [ ] No errors in CloudFormation events

## Estimated Deployment Time
- Clean deployment: 10-15 minutes
- If issues occur: Could take hours (as we experienced)

## Risk Assessment
- **HIGH RISK**: Hardcoded credentials will fail
- **HIGH RISK**: ACCOUNT_ID in names will cause conflicts
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Missing Lambda code will fail
- **LOW RISK**: GSI mismatches (won't fail deploy, but won't work)
