## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes)
1. **Test API Endpoints**
   ```bash
   # Test user registration
   curl -X POST https://ug63mrbfol.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/auth/register
   
   # Test catalog
   curl https://ug63mrbfol.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/catalog
   ```

2. **Seed Sample Data**
   ```bash
   ./seed-sample-data.ps1
   ```

3. **Deploy Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd packages/infrastructure
   # Add frontend stack to deployment
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Short Term (Next few hours)
4. **Configure Frontend Environment**

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- ✅ **Zero deployment failures**
- ✅ **All Lambda functions deployed**
- ✅ **All DynamoDB tables created with GSIs**
- ✅ **Admin user successfully created**
- ✅ **API Gateway fully configured**
- ✅ **No orphaned resources**
- ✅ **Clean stack deletion capability**

## 🔧 Technical Achievements

### Infrastructure Fixes Applied
- ✅ Removed all ACCOUNT_ID from resource names
- ✅ Changed all RETAIN policies to DESTROY
- ✅ Disabled expensive point-in-time recovery
- ✅ Removed VPC/RDS for cost optimization
- ✅ Fixed hardcoded credentials issues
- ✅ Proper stack composition architecture

### Development Best Practices
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
