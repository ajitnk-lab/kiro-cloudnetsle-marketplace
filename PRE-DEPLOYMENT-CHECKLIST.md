# Pre-Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES

### Data Stack (data-stack.ts)
- [x] Removed unused imports (rds, ec2)
- [x] Removed `cdk.Aws.ACCOUNT_ID` from ALL table names
- [x] Changed ALL tables to `removalPolicy: DESTROY`
- [x] Disabled `pointInTimeRecovery` on ALL tables
- [x] Fixed S3 bucket name (removed ACCOUNT_ID)

### Auth Stack (auth-stack.ts)
- [x] Changed User Pool to `removalPolicy: DESTROY`
- [x] Disabled Google OAuth (commented out - requires real credentials)
- [x] Removed dependency on googleProvider

### API Stack (api-stack.ts)
- [x] Changed Instamojo credentials to use environment variables with fallback

### Main Stack (marketplace-infrastructure-stack.ts)
- [x] Uses proper stack composition (DataStack, AuthStack, ApiStack)
- [x] Passes uniqueSuffix to prevent naming conflicts
- [x] Has proper CloudFormation outputs

## ‚úÖ VERIFIED COMPONENTS

### Lambda Functions
- [x] auth/register.js - EXISTS
- [x] auth/profile.js - EXISTS
- [x] auth/user-management.js - EXISTS
- [x] auth/partner-application.js - EXISTS
- [x] auth/post-confirmation.js - EXISTS
- [x] catalog/catalog.js - EXISTS
- [x] catalog/solution-management.js - EXISTS
- [x] payments/payment-handler.js - EXISTS
- [x] commission/commission-handler.js - EXISTS

### DynamoDB Tables (8 total)
- [x] UserTable with EmailIndex, RoleIndex
- [x] SolutionTable with PartnerIndex, CategoryIndex, StatusIndex
- [x] SessionTable with TTL
- [x] PartnerApplicationTable with UserIndex, StatusIndex
- [x] TransactionTable with UserIndex, PaymentRequestIndex, SolutionIndex
- [x] UserSolutionsTable with SolutionIndex
- [x] CommissionSettingsTable with CategoryIndex
- [x] PartnerEarningsTable with MonthIndex

### Other Resources
- [x] S3 AssetsBucket with lifecycle rules
- [x] Cognito User Pool with custom attributes
- [x] Cognito User Pool Client
- [x] API Gateway with CORS
- [x] Lambda execution roles with proper permissions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Acceptable for Dev)

1. **No Social Login**: Google/GitHub OAuth disabled (requires real credentials)
2. **Test Payment Credentials**: Instamojo using test credentials
3. **No VPC/RDS**: Removed to reduce costs and deployment time
4. **No Point-in-Time Recovery**: Disabled on all tables for cost savings
5. **DESTROY Removal Policy**: All resources will be deleted on stack deletion

## üéØ DEPLOYMENT READINESS

### Ready to Deploy: YES ‚úÖ

### Expected Deployment Time: 10-15 minutes

### Expected Resources Created:
- 1 CloudFormation Stack
- 8 DynamoDB Tables
- 1 S3 Bucket
- 1 Cognito User Pool
- 1 Cognito User Pool Client
- 1 API Gateway
- 9 Lambda Functions
- Multiple IAM Roles and Policies

### Post-Deployment Steps:
1. Verify stack deployment completed successfully
2. Check CloudFormation outputs for:
   - UserPoolId
   - UserPoolClientId
   - ApiEndpoint
   - Table names
   - Bucket name
3. Run admin user creation script
4. Test API endpoints
5. Seed sample data

## üö® DEPLOYMENT COMMAND

```bash
cd packages/infrastructure
npm run deploy
```

## üìä MONITORING DURING DEPLOYMENT

Watch for these potential issues:
- Lambda function creation failures (check handler names)
- DynamoDB GSI creation (takes extra time)
- S3 bucket creation (must be globally unique name)
- Cognito User Pool creation
- API Gateway deployment

## üîÑ ROLLBACK PLAN

If deployment fails:
1. Check CloudFormation events for specific error
2. Fix the issue in code
3. Run `aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name <stack-name>`
4. Wait for complete deletion
5. Redeploy with fixes

## ‚úÖ FINAL VERIFICATION

All critical issues fixed:
- ‚úÖ No ACCOUNT_ID in resource names
- ‚úÖ No RETAIN policies
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded credentials (using env vars)
- ‚úÖ No VPC/RDS resources
- ‚úÖ All Lambda files exist
- ‚úÖ Proper stack composition

**STATUS: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** üöÄ
